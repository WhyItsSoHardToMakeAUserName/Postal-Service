# Postal Service

## Getting Started
Ensure that you have .Net 8 installed 

To launch code type: <br />
dotnet run 

### Info
_deliveryOrder is stored inside DeliveryOrder Table inside Database <br />
_deliveryLog is stored in _deliveryLog.txt file <br />

No particular reason for storing solution <br />
Just wanted to try both methods <br /> 

# Example input
hollywood:2024-10-22 23:20:00 <br />
georgetown:2024-10-22 23:00:00 <br />

### Quality of life
If you are using vscode install SQLite extension <br />
It helped me a lot to see actual data inside local db <br />
